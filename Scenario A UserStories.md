Scenario A. Pre-Script

“Pre-Script is a brand new project aimed at the development of a smartphone app that reminds users when their prescriptions are due to be picked up or renewed. Forgetting to take medicine can be fatal and is a problem for those in society who are the most vulnerable, such as the sick and elderly. By creating Pre-Script we can help patients and their carers ensure they are taking the prescriptions they need, when they need them.” (Team 2A, 2019)4

Q-1: What features or functionalities would you find most helpful in a prescription reminder app like "Pre-Script"?

Ans: There will be a login system where users can create account by putting their NHS number and would like to put their preferred GP so that when they are due to take medicine and send an auto request to the GP. Further, they just get reminders according to their previous medicine prescriptions. 


Q-2: How many days in advance and how often would you like to be notified?
10 days before prescription is due, every month

Q-3: What will be your preferred method of receiving reminders about your prescription pick-ups or renewals?(eg, app notifications, email notifications,text messages)
-Text messages and email.

Q-4 : What do you expect to happen if you can't pick up your prescription on a certain day? 
After getting notified on a pick up date, I should be able to change to another date that suits me better. A deadline will be given before I have to re-order. 

**Q5 >>** Would they like to have paid delivery options in case they can't make it?

**A >>** Yes home delivery of the medicine is preferred with a service charge in case the patient is too busy to pickup themselves but it should be a signed one not just being dropped off at the mail box kind.
