Scenario A. Pre-Script

“Pre-Script is a brand new project aimed at the development of a smartphone app that reminds users when their prescriptions are due to be picked up or renewed. Forgetting to take medicine can be fatal and is a problem for those in society who are the most vulnerable, such as the sick and elderly. By creating Pre-Script we can help patients and their carers ensure they are taking the prescriptions they need, when they need them.” (Team 2A, 2019)4
